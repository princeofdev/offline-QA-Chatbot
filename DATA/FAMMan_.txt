                      Information window in QuickBooks. To get to this window in QuickBooks,
                      go to the Company menu and select Company Information.

                        QuickBooks company, you need to create a new Fixed Asset Manager client
                        associated with this QuickBooks company. For more information on creating
                        the new client file, refer to the next section titled Creating a new client file.

                      is running on the same workstation at the same time.

                  To open a new client file and begin entering asset information, you must first
                  enter basic client file information and determine the type of information that you
                  want to maintain. The New Client Wizard steps you through this process.

             Using shortcut menus
             In several places throughout the program, you
             can click the right mouse button to view a
             shortcut menu with common tasks for that
             particular area.
             Shortcut menus are available in the Schedule,
             Asset, Projection, Notes and Calendar folders.
             The main shortcut menu for the Schedule folder
             is shown on the right.


             This shortcut menu appears when you right-click
             a column heading in the Schedule folder and it
             contains commands that allow you to modify
             Schedule views.




             Using the Tab toolbar
             The Tab toolbar contains six tabs  Schedule, Asset, Disposal, Projection,
             Notes, and Calendar. When you click a tab, the corresponding folder opens.




Important:    You can also use commands on the View menu to open a folder.


             Selecting a tab and corresponding folder
             To view or edit information in one of the six folders, click the tab that
             corresponds to the folder that you want to use.
             The first folder in the Fixed Asset Manager window is the Schedule folder. In
             this folder, assets appear in a tabular list with columns that you can use to select
             and sort. Totals for each numeric column appear on the Totals line.
             Tabs at the bottom of the work area allow you to view information for a specific
             basis (Federal, AMT, ACE, Book, State and Other). For detailed information
             about customizing the contents of the Schedule folder, refer to the section titled
             Defining column sets for the Schedule folder later in this chapter.

Important:    When you go to the Asset, Disposal, Projection or Notes folder, you see
              information about the asset thats selected in the Schedule folder.




                                        Starting and Setting Up Fixed Asset Manager            15
                   Use this folder    For this purpose

                   Asset              Enter general information about each asset, such as the
                                      account number and description, custom groupings and links
                                      to tax forms. The bottom half of this folder shows calculations
                                      and depreciation criteria, such as the tax system, method and
                                      convention.

                   Disposal           Enter information regarding the sale of an asset.

                   Projection         Presents projected depreciation calculations for the life of the
                                      asset.

                   Notes              Enter comments about the current asset. You can add a note to
                                      each asset.

                   Calendar           Presents a monthly view of the date each asset was placed in
                                      service. Any assets placed in service on a specified day are
                                      listed on that calendar date. Assets also appear by their
                                      disposition date. Use the Calendar folder to locate and edit
                                      assets.




               Using the status bar
               The status bar shows you the basis that youve chosen for the current asset, the
               total number of assets on the list, and the year-end date of the client. When you
               select a command on a menu, you can see a description of that command on the
               status bar.
               When youre viewing the Schedule folder, the status bar presents information
               about the current client and selected asset. When youre not viewing the
               Schedule folder, the status bar indicates which asset you are editing and includes
               other information about the asset. For example, it might tell you to recalculate or
               save the asset.
               Use the Status Bar command on the View menu to hide or show the status bar.




Selecting program options
               To customize your program settings, go to the Tools menu and select Program
               Options. When the Program Options window appears, the tab that was last
               viewed is selected. To select options from another section of the Program
               Options window, click the appropriate tab.

Selecting QuickBooks asset synchronization options
                By default, QuickBooks and Fixed Asset Manager share information while
                maintaining separate data files in separate locations.
                Setting the options to automatic synchronization pulls asset data from
                QuickBooks fixed asset item list when Fixed Asset Manager is opened or when
                a change is made within QuickBooks while Fixed Asset Manager is open, and
                you switch from QuickBooks back to Fixed Asset Manager.
                Fixed Asset Manager allows you to designate how often and when this asset
                information gets shared.

   Important:    Synchronization between Fixed Asset Manager and QuickBooks will be
                 disabled if more than one version of QuickBooks is running on the same
                 workstation at the same time.



                To set the asset synchronization options:
                 1 From the QuickBooks menu, select Asset Synchronization Options.
                 2 Click the From QuickBooks tab to make the selections on how you want to
                    update fixed asset items from QuickBooks.
                 3 Click the To QuickBooks tab to make the selections on how you want to
                    save asset information to QuickBooks.
                 4 Click OK to save your changes.



Defining column sets for the Schedule folder
                The Schedule folder lists asset information in a series of columns. The
                information that appears in each column flows from the data fields in the Asset
                or Disposal folders.

   Important:    Some client information can be found only in the Disposal folder or in the
                 depreciation reports that you create.



                Applying a column set to the Schedule folder
                Fixed Asset Manager comes with these standard column sets: Asset Listing,
                Category Listing and Lead Schedule.

                            Creating a custom column set
                            You can customize the columns that you want to see in the Schedule folder, and
                            place columns in the order that you want.
                            To create a custom column set:

Backing up and copying a client file
                To back up a client file to another drive or to a floppy disk:
                 1 From the File menu, select Backup.
                 2 When the Backup window appears, click Browse to select the location for
                    the backup file.
                 3 Click Backup to continue to back up the Fixed Asset Manager client file.
                    It is important to remember that these files are separate from the
                    QuickBooks clients files, and that both should be backed up regularly.

   Important:    Because of the link between QuickBooks client files and Fixed Asset Manager
                 client files, you should always use the backup and restore functions and not
                 other means to manipulate or copy client files.




   Important:    You cannot restore a backup from a previous version.
                 If you do not have a current backup to restore, you can run the Transfer Client
                 routine again for this client.
                 To restore a previous version backup, you must install that version of Fixed
                 Asset Manager and restore the backup. After you do that, run the Transfer
                 Client routine in the current version of Fixed Asset Manger to transfer the
                 fixed assets to the current tax year.

                To restore a previously backed up client:
                 1 From the File menu, select Restore.
                 2 When the Restore window appears, click Browse to select the location of
                    your backed up client file.
                 3 Click Restore to continue to restore the Fixed Asset Manager client file.

Importing asset data from Comma Separated Value files
                   You can import depreciation information from another fixed asset management
                   program into a Fixed Asset Manager client file if the other fixed asset
                   management program can save asset data to a Comma Separated Value (CSV)
                   format file. CSV format, which is recognized by most word processing and
                   spreadsheet applications, uses the .csv file name extension.

           Tip:        If the other fixed asset management program cant save to a file in CSV
                       format but can save to a file in a format that is readable by Microsoft Excel,
                       save the asset data to a file in the format that is readable by Excel, open that
                       file in Excel, then save the asset data in CSV format.


                   Preparing a CSV format file
                   The imported CSV file must be in a format that is usable to Fixed Asset Manager.
                   Use these guidelines to prepare your client file for importing:
                   ?      A single CSV file can represent only one clients data. (In other words, there
                          must be one CSV file for each client).
                   ?      Each row of data can represent only one asset. Each column must contain the
                          same type of data. (For example, the asset names should be in the same
                          column).
                   ?      Each row of client data must have the same number of columns.
                   ?      The file can have column headings.
                   ?      While there can be blank rows at the beginning of the file, after the first row
                          of client data is defined, there cant be any more rows without client data.
                   ?      Although commas must separate all values, the individual values in the
                          record can be enclosed with double quotes.

           Tip:        To verify that a file is correctly formatted, first open it in Microsoft Excel.


                   Importing asset data from a CSV format file
                   Before importing asset data from another depreciation program, make sure that
                   youve set up a Fixed Asset Manager file to receive the imported data. The Fixed
                   Asset Manager file must have the same characteristics (such as, tax return type
                   and fiscal year dates) as the file from which youre importing asset data.

     Important:        If you dont import prior depreciation or current depreciation (or both), Fixed
                       Asset Manager calculates depreciation for you. If you do import prior or
                       current depreciation (or both), then you recalculate depreciation after
                       importing, prior and current depreciation amounts may change.

             To import asset data from a CSV format file into a Fixed Asset Manager client
             file:
              1 From the File menu, select Import, then select Comma Separated (CSV).
              2 Read the instructions in the Welcome page, then click Next.
              3 In the Select File page, type the full path for the .csv file that you want or
                 click the Browse button to search for the .csv file.
              4 Click Next.
              5 Select an import template option.

      Tip:    An import template tells Fixed Asset Manager how the data in a file is
              organized. After you set up an import template, you can use it to import other
              files in the same format. Templates are transferred automatically when you
              install a new version of Fixed Asset Manager.

                  If youre importing asset data for the first time or if you want to create a
                   new import template from scratch, select Create Template, then click
                   Next.
                  If you want to use a template that has the same layout (such as the same
                   number of columns and the same column order) as the CSV format file,
                   select Use Existing Template, then click Finish.
                  If you want to modify a template that you created for CSV format files,
                   select Edit Existing Template, then click Next.

Important:    Dont select the Fixed Asset Manager sample CSV template.

              6 If your clients CSV file tracks AMT, ACE, Book, State or Other bases and
                 you want to import them, select those bases.
                 Note the following:
                  Federal is always selected because you always must classify assets for
                   federal depreciation bases.
                  You cant clear the Federal basis selection.

Important:    Make sure that you analyze the client file carefully. Youll want to select only
              the depreciation bases that are in the CSV file and that you want to import.
              You can add other bases to the client file after the data is entered in Fixed
              Asset Manager.

              7 When you finish making selections, click Next.
              8 Read the instructions in the Column Heading and Row Selection page
                 carefully.

                       9 If your clients CSV file has column headings at the top of the file, select Yes
                          under Does your CSV file contain column headings?
                          When you select this option, youll notice that the client data in the first row
                          becomes your new column headings. If the column headings begin on a
                          different row, specify the row number in the box that appears next to the Yes
                          - The headings are on row option.
                          If the client data begins on a row other than the row indicated in the box for
                          the Yes - The headings are on row option, specify the row number in the
                          On which row does your asset data begin? box.
                   10 When you finish making selections, click Next.
                   11 Read the instructions in the Defining Your Import Template page
                          carefully. Map data fields in the CSV format file to corresponding data fields
                          in the Fixed Asset Manager client file.
                          Starting with the first column in the Fixed Asset Manager Fields section,
                          click the list box to view the available Fixed Asset Manager fields. Select the
                          field to which you want to map the data field in the CSV format file.

     Important:        You must make a selection for all Required Fixed Asset Manager fields and
                       any other fields that you want to import. Make sure that you examine the
                       entire list when making a selection. If youre not sure how to map fields, refer
                       to the section titled Mapping fields from an export file to Fixed Asset
                       Manager later in this chapter before you continue.

                          Some asset fields in the clients data may relate to more than one field in
                          Fixed Asset Manager. For example, the data may have a field that includes
                          information about both Method and Convention, which are two separate
                          fields in Fixed Asset Manager. If you need to map data to multiple fields,
                          complete step 12 through step 14. Otherwise, go directly to step 15.
                   12 In the pick list for the column, click <Multiple Fields>.
                   13 In the Select Multiple Fields page, select the applicable fields for the
                          column that youre mapping.
                          For example, for Method/Convention, select (Federal) Convention and
                          (Federal) Method.
                   14 When you finish making selections, click OK.
                   15 Continue mapping the remaining columns to Fixed Asset Manager in the
                          Defining Your Import Template page.
                          If you have a column that cant be mapped, or a column that you dont want
                          to import, and the column is not a required field for Fixed Asset Manager,
                          select Dont Import.
                          To learn more about mapping client data to multiple Fixed Asset Manager
                          fields, refer to the section titled Mapping a single CSV field to multiple

   Important:    You must map CSV data to all required Fixed Asset Manager fields in the
                 import template.

                16 When you finish mapping CSV data to Fixed Asset Manager fields, click
                    Next.
                17 In the Define Method (Federal) page, go to the (Federal) Method column,
                    then click the list box and select the federal method of depreciation for each
                    row. Each row in the Method column represents a unique combination of
                    data from the CSV file.
                    If you selected additional bases on the Select Bases page in step 6, Fixed
                    Asset Manager displays the Define Method page for each basis that you
                    selected.
                18 When you finish making selections, click Next.
                19 The Define Convention page appears if you mapped the Convention field
                    in the Defining Your Import Template page in step 11. Go to the
                    Convention section, then click the list box and select the convention for
                    each row. Each row represents a unique combination of data from the CSV
                    file.
                20 When you finish making selections, click Next.
                21 In the Finished page, type a name for the import template, click Save, then
                    click Finish to begin importing the clients asset data.
                22 When Fixed Asset Manager finishes importing the clients asset data, review
                    the exception log so you are aware of any exceptions that Fixed Asset
                    Manager recorded, and carefully review the imported data for accuracy.

         Tip:    You can use the import template that you created for other client CSV format
                 files that have a similar layout (such as the same number of columns and the
                 same column order).




Mapping fields from an export file to Fixed Asset Manager
                Previous sections of this chapter discussed the steps you need to take during the
                import procedure to map asset fields from an export file created by another
                program into Fixed Asset Manager. This section describes the concept of
                mapping in more detail.
                Mapping is the process of correlating asset information from one program to
                another program. For example, you may need to map a data field in an asset
                depreciation program that contains date placed in service information to a similar
                field (such as date acquired) in another depreciation program.

                 Date Placed in
                                                                    Date Acquired
                    Service



             When importing a clients asset data into Fixed Asset Manager, first map
             corresponding asset fields from the export file to fields available in Fixed Asset
             Manager. During the import procedure, youll create an import template, which is
             a special file containing mapping information that you can reuse to import asset
             data from export files for other clients.
             When applying depreciation methods, note that some depreciation programs
             define federal depreciation methods by using asset types (such as Real Property,
             Luxury Automobile, Listed Property, etc.) to define the required method of
             depreciation. Fixed Asset Manager combines statutory asset types that can exist
             as a separate field in other depreciation programs with Fixed Asset Managers
             federal depreciation methods.
             Fixed Asset Manager calculates the method and convention fields for AMT and
             ACE bases. For ACRS and MACRS assets, Fixed Asset Manager also calculates
             the Section 179 deduction from the federal basis and disables salvage value.
             Fixed Asset Manager selects the appropriate AMT and ACE recovery period if
             they have not been mapped.
             You must map fields in each clients export file to the following five fields in
             Fixed Asset Manager:
             ?   Asset Description
             ?   Date Acquired
             ?   Cost
             ?   Method
             ?   Life
             If AMT, ACE, Book, State or Other bases exist in your Fixed Asset Manager
             client file but have not been mapped in your template, Fixed Asset Manager sets
             Date Acquired and Cost for these bases to the federal bases, and sets Method to
             the client template default value.

Important:    Fixed Asset Manager allows you to map the ID or the description for the
              following fields:
                  Category
                  Location
                  Vendor/Manufacturer
                  Amortization
                  User Defined 1 through 5
              If you map both the ID and the description in Fixed Asset Manager, only the
              description of the field is imported.



             Mapping field types
             You can map three types of fields for a clients asset data in Fixed Asset
             Manager:
             ?   Fields that can have a one-to-one correspondence and that require data entry
                 (such as Asset Description 1, Cost and Life)
             ?   Fields for which the valid entries are included on a pre-defined list (such as
                 Method, Convention and Switch to S/L)
             ?   Fields for which the valid entries are included on a list that you define (such
                 as Category, Location, Vendor, Amortization Code and User Defined Fields
                 1-5)
             To translate the various methods or conventions, or to determine whether a
             declining balance method asset switches to straight-line, you may be required to
             map a field (in other words, a column) in the clients asset data to more than one
             field in Fixed Asset Manager. You may also be required to map a field in the
             clients asset data more than once.
             In Fixed Asset Manager, the Method, Convention, Switch to Straight-Line, and
             Disposition Property Type fields each contain a list of values or items. When you
             map multiple fields in a clients asset data to these fields, the Import wizard
             creates a list of unique combinations of items in the data consisting of multiple
             fields mapped to one Fixed Asset Manager field. You must select the list item for
             each Fixed Asset Manager field that most closely represents the Method,
             Convention, and so on that is coming from the clients asset data.
             To import your clients asset data, use the Fixed Asset Manager Import Wizard.
             For information about how to use the Import wizard, refer to the section titled
             Importing asset data from Comma Separated Value files on page 36, or
             Mapping fields from an export file to Fixed Asset Manager on page 39.

             Mapping examples
             As a simple example, assume that you are mapping a Comma Separated Value
             (CSV) data file and that the file was exported from a depreciation program that
             uses an asset field named Date Placed in Service. There isnt a field named Date
             Placed in Service in Fixed Asset Manager, but there is a field named Date
             Acquired. In this case, you would map the Date Placed In Service field in the
             clients export file to the Date Acquired field in Fixed Asset Manager.
             As you map a clients data, you may find other asset fields in the clients export
             file that are correlated (mapped) to Fixed Asset Managers asset fields. For
             example:
             ?   Convention
             ?   Asset Type
             ?   Prior Depreciation
             ?   Current Depreciation
             ?   Business Use Percentage

A more complicated example is an asset field named Type that identifies the type
of depreciation treatment prescribed for a given asset. Among the values in the
Type field in the CSV data file you are importing is a code of RP, which
identifies a real property asset in the Type field.
In defining your import template, you would map the Type field from the CSV
format file to the Method field in Fixed Asset Manager. (Note that Method is a
required field in Fixed Asset Manager.) This mapping would define the Fixed
Asset Manager federal depreciation method for real property.

             Mapping multiple CSV fields to one Fixed Asset Manager
             field
             When you are mapping several fields from a CSV format file to only one field in
             Fixed Asset Manager, you may encounter a situation like the following:
             ?        The CSV format file from which you are importing asset data contains fields
                      named Asset Type and Method that identify the federal method for each
                      asset in the CSV format file.
             You already know that the CSV format file contains the following two ACRS
             depreciable real assets: Personal Tangible Property (TANG) and Real Property
             (REAL).
             In this case, you must correctly define the federal depreciation method for each
             of these MACRS assets, because the Asset Type and Method fields in the CSV
             format file do not distinguish between MACRS Personal Tangible Property and
             MACRS Real Property.
             If both Personal Tangible Property and Real Property are required to be
             depreciated using the MACRS Straight-line method, you must map the Asset
             Type and Method fields in your CSV data file to Fixed Asset Managers
             Method (Federal) field.

             Mapping a single CSV field to multiple Fixed Asset
             Manager fields
             Lets assume the depreciation program that the CSV format file was exported
             from uses a field called Method/Convention to define an assets federal
             depreciation method and convention. Among the values in the Method/
             Convention field in the CSV data file is a code of ADMM. This code identifies
             the federal depreciation method as MACRS Alternate Depreciation System
             (MACRS ADS) and the federal MACRS convention as mid-month.
             In defining your import template, you must map the Method/Convention field
             from the CSV format file to the Method and Convention fields in Fixed Asset
             Manager. This defines the Fixed Asset Manager federal depreciation method and
             convention for a MACRS asset being depreciated under the Alternate
             Depreciation System (ADS) using a mid-month convention.

Tracking depreciation
                   Depreciation is a method of tracking the decline of an assets value for
                   accounting and tax purposes. When using depreciation for accounting purposes,
                   you can express it as the cost of an asset versus income over a period of time. At
                   the end of an assets life, the sum of depreciation for previous years equals its
                   cost minus any salvage value.
                   When depreciating assets for tax purposes, you can define depreciation as the
                   decline of an items market value over the course of its life. Businesses may
                   expense a portion of the assets cost each year for the use of the asset.
                   A fixed asset is any piece of equipment or property used by a business that has a
                   life of at least one year. It must be in a fully assembled or otherwise usable
                   condition and must also be considered an item that is subject to wear and tear.
                   This chapter shows you how to add assets to your clients file in Fixed Asset
                   Manager. It also shows you how to manage assets in Fixed Asset Manager,
                   including tracking depreciation, synchronizing with QuickBooks and the sale of
                   assets.




Updating assets from QuickBooks
                   If you have set Fixed Asset Manager synchronization options to manual, you can
                   use the Update Assets from QuickBooks selection to bring any changed items
                   from QuickBooks into Fixed Asset Manager. You can also use this to force
                   synchronization if you have the options set to automatic.

     Important:        Synchronization options in Fixed Asset Manager will be disabled if more than
                       one version of QuickBooks is running on the same workstation at the same
                       time. Close all other versions of QuickBooks that may be open before
                       updating assets from QuickBooks.

                       1 From the QuickBooks menu, select Update Assets from QuickBooks.
                       2 Make your selection for which type of asset you would like to update.
                       3 Click OK.
                          You can also designate that synchronization occur automatically when
                          opening Fixed Asset Manager. This is the recommended setting.

Using the Schedule folder to view a clients assets
                       When you open a client file, the Schedule folder lists the clients assets in
                       ascending order according to asset number.


To change the
column set, asset
sort set or query
criteria, use the
Asset toolbar.

Use the mouse to
resize columns and
to drag and drop a
column in a
different position.




                       To view amounts for any basis supported in           This is the totals line.
                       the clients file, click the applicable tab.



                       You can change the asset list and the columns in the Schedule folder using the
                       View Column Set, Sort Assets By and Apply Query Criteria controls on the
                       Asset toolbar. For more information on using these tools, refer to Chapter 2,
                       Starting and Setting Up Fixed Asset Manager.

                Tip:    If an asset doesnt appear in the Schedule folder, check the query selection on
                        the Asset toolbar. If the asset falls outside the current query, it wont appear in
                        the Schedule folder.

                       To view amounts for any basis supported in a clients file, click the
                       corresponding tab at the bottom of the window.

                Tip:    The Total line shows the accumulated values of each numerical column. You
                        can leave the total line at the bottom of the asset list or you can lock it in place
                        at the bottom of the screen. For more information about this option, refer to
                        Chapter 2, Starting and Setting Up Fixed Asset Manager.

                If you want to increase or decrease the magnification of the contents of the
                Schedule folder, go to the View menu, select Magnify, then select the
                magnification percentage that you want. (The default selection is 100%.) The
                percentage you select remains in effect until you select a different percentage.
                To change the column width so all columns appear in the Schedule folder without
                scrolling, go to the View menu and select Resize all columns.




Disposing multiple assets at once
                Fixed Asset Manager allows you to dispose of more than one asset at one time.
                To do this, youll use the Fixed Asset Manager Dispose Multiple Assets wizard:
                    1 Select the assets you want to dispose of in the Schedule folder. Use the Ctrl
                      key on the keyboard and the left mouse button to select the assets.
                    2 From the Asset menu, select Dispose Assets.
                    3 In the Dispose Multiple Assets window, enter the Disposition date for all
                      assets being disposed. Fixed Asset Manager uses the last day of the client
                      year as the default. Enter the complete month, day and year of the
                      disposition. This date affects the amount of depreciation calculated for the
                      current year and how the gain is treated on the clients tax return.
                      Also, enter a Sale Description for all assets using up to 50 letters or
                      numbers. You do not have to choose a unique description. Fixed Asset
                      Manager reminds you if the Sales Description has been used before in the
                      client file. When you are finished with your entries, click Next.
                    4 Use the Property Type window to indicate where the information for this
                      disposal should print on the Form 4797 Tax Worksheets and where it should
                      be reported on Form 4797, Sales of Property in the ProSeries Tax client.
                      Click Next.
                    5 Use the Allocation Method for Disposition Amounts window to select
                      either Use the same amounts for all assets or Allocation amounts using
                      the basis (Federal, AMT, ACE, Book, State, Other) and either Cost or
                      Remaining Basis, then click Next.
                    6 In the following series of wizard screens, enter the amount in the Total for
                      all assets box. Youll notice that Fixed Asset Manager automatically
                      allocates the percent and amount to each asset for each of these wizard
                      screens:
                       Allocate Sales Price
                       Allocate Sales Expense
                       Allocate ITC Taken
                       Allocate Disposition Basis

                   Make sure you enter the total amount for all assets, then if necessary, modify
                   the percent or amount to allocate to individual assets. You must allocate
                   100% of the total. As you change the amount or percent for individual assets,
                   any unallocated amount is reflected in the Unallocated: line. The
                   Unallocated amount can be allocated evenly between all assets by entering
                   0.00 in the Unallocated: line.
                7 In the Summary page, a summary table of the assets that you selected to
                   dispose appears. Review the table carefully. You can use your mouse to
                   resize any columns of information that are too narrow. Click Back if you
                   want to go back and edit a selection, otherwise, click Finish.

        Tip:    If you want to remove all disposition information from selected assets in the
                Schedule folder, select Undispose Assets from the Asset menu.




Splitting an asset into two or more assets
               You can create two or more assets from one existing asset in Fixed Asset
               Manager. When you dispose of an asset, you may have a need to perform a
               partial disposition where you must first divide the asset into two or more new
               assets, then dispose of one or more of the new assets.
               To split an asset, select the asset in the Schedule folder, then go to the Asset
               menu and select Split Asset.
               In the Split Asset window, youll select the number of new assets you want to
               create, then adjust the amounts or percentages for each asset. If you want to
               allocate amounts evenly, enter 0.00 in the Unallocated field.




                                                                         Enter 0.00 in
                                                                         Unallocated to
                                                                         allocate amounts to all
                                                                         assets equally




               When you click OK, Fixed Asset Manager copies the fields that are entered on
               the Asset and Basis detail panes to the new assets. There is an exception for the
               dollar amounts that are allocated to each asset using the percentage you assign to
               the asset in the Percent column.


                                            Entering and Managing Asset Information                49
                   The fields that are allocated using the percentages you specify are:
                   ?       Cost or basis
                   ?       Section 179 deduction
                   ?       Special Depreciation Allowance
                   ?       ITC basis reduction
                   ?       Other deductions
                   ?       Salvage value
                   ?       Prior depreciation




Changing multiple groupings and accounts
                   Use the Assign Grouping to Asset... and the Assign G/L Accounts to Assets...
                   commands on the Asset menu to set the Groupings and Accounts for a number of
                   assets at once. Youll select the assets you want to modify in the Schedule folder.

     Important:        This powerful feature enables you to modify asset information in any or all
                       assets at one time. If you are modifying a large number of assets at once, you
                       may want to back up the client file before proceeding.

                   To change groupings:
                       1   While in the Schedule folder, select the assets you would like to group.
                       2   From the Asset menu, select Assign Groups to Assets.
                       3   You can select one or multiple groupings to assign to the assets.
                       4   Click OK.
                   To change accounts:
                       1 Select the assets to which you would like to apply an account
                       2 From the Asset menu, select Assign G/L Assets to Accounts.
                       3 Assign an Asset Account, Depreciation/Amortization Account and
                           Depreciation/Amortization Expense accounts.
                       4 Click OK.



Changing the Tax Form link for multiple assets
                   You can change the tax form link for several assets at once which can save you a
                   lot of time if you use the Tax Worksheets or export assets to ProSeries, or both.

Saving assets to QuickBooks
                Use this method to transfer and update any changed asset items from Fixed Asset
                Manager to the Fixed Asset Item list in QuickBooks. If the Fixed Asset Manager
                synchronization options are set to Manual, you must use this method to update
                any asset items from Fixed Asset Manager to QuickBooks. You can also use this
                method to force synchronization if you have the synchronization options set to
                perform automatically.

   Important:    Synchronization options in Fixed Asset Manager will be disabled if more than
                 one version of QuickBooks is running on the same workstation at the same
                 time. Close all other versions of QuickBooks that may be open before
                 updating assets from QuickBooks.

                 1 From the QuickBooks menu, select Save Assets to QuickBooks. If this
                    selection is unavailable (grayed out), you need to assign accounts to the
                    selected asset.
                 2 Make your selection for the type of asset you want to update.

             ?   MACRS, for dates after 1/1/87
             ?   Amortization, for intangible assets
             ?   Section 168(f)(1), for assets depreciated on a units-of-production basis

             Entering the depreciation method
             Review the list of choices for the active tax system and make a selection
             according to the asset type.

             Selecting an assets recovery period
             The assets recovery period is the amount of time over which depreciation may
             be deducted.
             Enter the appropriate life of this asset for each basis. The format of this field is
             yy/mm. For example, an asset with a life of twenty-seven-and-one-half years is
             27/06.
             Based on the assets tax system and method, an appropriate default appears.
             Use the class life tables established by IRS code (Publication 946, Appendix B)
             to select from one of eight recovery periods for MACRS assets. The tables assign
             a GDS class life (used by MACRS) and an ADS class life (used with ACE, AMT
             and for 150% MACRS assets placed in service before 1/1/99). Assigned MACRS
             property classes are 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20-year property; water utility property;
             residential rental property; non-residential real property; railroad gradings or
             tunnel bores; and qualified Indian reservation property.

Important:    Fixed Asset Manager does not currently support qualified Indian reservation
              property.

             ACRS assets are assigned a recovery class that determines the recovery period or
             life, for the asset. Allowed recovery periods for ACRS assets are 3, 5, 10, 15, 18
             and 19 years. Alternative recovery periods are available with alternative methods
             or listed property.
             For assets placed in service before MACRS or assets that do not qualify for
             MACRS, you must determine the assets useful life. Useful life is an estimate of
             how long your client expects to use the item in trade or business.

             Selecting the averaging convention
             A convention applies for each asset based on the date acquired and the method
             used. The averaging convention you select affects the depreciation calculated for
             the first year the asset is placed in service and the year of its disposition or the
             final year of depreciation.




                                          Entering and Managing Asset Information               57
             To change this value, click the down arrow to see the list of choices, then make a
             selection.
             The averaging conventions are:
             ?   Half-Year  Treats property as placed in service or disposed of at the mid-
                 point of the year. This convention applies to all MACRS personal property
                 unless more than 40% of the total depreciable basis of all personal property
                 assets were placed in service in the last three months of the year. When this
                 limit is exceeded, Fixed Asset Manager uses the MACRS mid-quarter
                 convention (see below).
             ?   Mid-Quarter  Treats property as placed in service at the mid-point of the
                 quarter. This convention applies when 40% of the total depreciable basis of
                 all personal property were placed into service in the last three months of the
                 year. To determine whether you need to use the mid-quarter convention:
                    - Go to the Tools menu and select 179/40% Test.
                    - In the Section 179/40% Text window, click the 40% Test tab.
                    - Review the information, then click OK.
             ?   Mid-Month  Treats MACRS real property as placed in service or
                 disposed of at the mid-point of the month.
             ?   Act-Days (Actual Days)  Applies depreciation for the actual number of
                 days the asset was in service for the year of purchase and the year of
                 disposition.
             ?   APL-ACRS  Used for personal property, this option allows a full year of
                 depreciation when the asset is first placed in service, and no depreciation in
                 the year of disposition. Real property is depreciated based on the month
                 placed in service, and a pro-rated amount is allowed in the year of
                 disposition.
             ?   Full-Month  Depreciates all assets as if they were purchased or disposed
                 of on the first of the month.
             ?   Half-Month  Treats assets placed in service in the first half of the month
                 or disposed of in the second half of the month as being in service for the
                 entire month. Assets placed in service in the second half of the month or
                 disposed of in the first half of the month are treated as not being in service
                 for the entire month.

             Entering Section 179 deductions
             Enter the amount of the Section 179 deduction to be taken in the current year or
             the amount that has been taken in the prior year for this asset.
             Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code permits certain taxpayers to deduct all
             or part of the cost of qualifying property in the year they placed it in service,
             instead of depreciating the basis over a specified recovery period. There are
             limits to the amount that can be deducted in a tax year. These limits include a
             total dollar limit, an investment business cost limit and an income limit.

Important:    Fixed Asset Manager does not support excluding tangible personal property
              associated with residential rental activity from the calculation of the
              investment cost limit. You must subtract any such assets from the investment
              business cost limit calculated by Fixed Asset Manager.

             Observing Section 179 limits
             Refer to the IRS website (www.irs.gov) for this years details about:
             Dollar limit  The maximum annual business cost you can deduct under Section
             179. The limit applies to each taxpayer, not to each business. You may expense
             the entire basis of an asset up to the dollar limitations, or expense a portion of
             several assets and depreciate any remaining cost.
             Gulf Opportunity Zone  The maximum annual business cost that companies
             with property in the Gulf Opportunity Zone can deduct.

                 Investment business cost limit, including the investment business cost limit for
                 property in the Gulf Opportunity Zone.
                 Taxable Income limit  The Section 179 deduction that can be taken in a given
                 tax year is limited to the taxable income generated for that year:
                 ?   An individuals taxable income is figured by determining the net income
                     from all trades and businesses that the taxpayer and the taxpayers spouse
                     (when married filing jointly) conducted during the tax year. This includes
                     Section 1231 gains (or losses), interest from working capital of the trade or
                     business, and wages, salaries, tips or other compensation earned as an
                     employee. Any disallowed cost can be carried over to the next tax year.
                 ?   The Section 179 deduction applies to both the partnership and each partner.
                     The partnership determines its Section 179 deduction and allocates the
                     deduction among its partners. Each partner adds the amount allocated from
                     the partnership to his or her other Section 179 costs and then applies the
                     maximum dollar limit to this total to determine his or her Section 179
                     deduction. The investment business cost limits of individual partners are not
                     affected by partnership property placed in service. The total amount of each
                     partners Section 179 deduction is subject to both the taxable income limit,
                     the maximum dollar limit and the investment business cost limits on
                     nonpartnership property.
                 ?   The rules that apply to a partnership and its partners also apply to an
                     S corporation and its shareholders. The limits apply to an S corporation and
                     to each shareholder. The corporation allocates the deduction to the
                     shareholders, who then take their Section 179 deduction subject to the
                     limitations.
                 For luxury automobiles, the limitation is the luxury automobile limitation for the
                 year. The deduction is not allowed if an assets business-use percentage is 50% or
                 less. The depreciable basis of the asset is reduced by the amount of the deduction
                 taken.
                 The deduction on the book, state and other basis is not included in any
                 calculations for those bases.

                 Rules for taking the Special Depreciation Allowance
                 The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 provided for a 30% Special
                 Depreciation Allowance for certain property placed in service after September
                 10, 2001. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 increased
                 the Special Depreciation Allowance to 50% and increased the Luxury Auto limits
                 for Passenger Automobiles and Clean Fuel Vehicles. Revenue Procedure 2003-

                 3.   Intangible property that is amortizable under IRC section 197 is not
                      property qualified for the Special Depreciation Allowance.
                 4.   Residential rental property and nonresidential real property generally do
                      not qualify for the Special Depreciation Allowance, except for:
                      (a) certain nonresidential qualified leasehold improvements, and
                      (b) certain residential rental and nonresidential real property placed in
                          service within the Liberty Zone.
                      Exceptions:
                         Residential rental property: New York Liberty Zone residential
                          rental property is qualified property to the extent it replaces
                          property destroyed or condemned as a result of the terrorist attacks
                          of September 11, 2001.
                         Nonresidential real property: Leasehold improvements may be
                          qualifying property. The leasehold improvement must (1) be placed
                          in service more than three years after the building was placed in
                          service, and (2) not be a qualified New York Liberty Zone leasehold
                          improvement property.
                 5.   New York Liberty Zone nonresidential property is qualified property to
                      the extent that it replaces property destroyed or condemned as a result of
                      the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and is not a qualified New
                      York Liberty Zone leasehold improvement.
             Qualified property does not include:
                  Listed property used 50% or less for business
                  Any property required to be depreciated under the Alternative
                   Depreciation System (ADS), and
                  Qualified New York Liberty Zone leasehold improvement property

             Qualified New York Liberty Zone leasehold improvement property
             Qualified New York Liberty Zone leasehold improvement property is not eligible
             for the Special Depreciation Allowance. Instead, Qualified New York Liberty
             Zone leasehold improvement property is depreciated as 5-year property using the
             straight-line method. A 9-year period is used for purposes of the Alternative
             Depreciation System (ADS).

             Luxury Auto Limits for Qualified Trucks and Vans, Passenger Autos, and
             Electric Vehicles placed in service after September 10, 2001
             Qualifying vehicles subject to luxury automobile depreciation limits are eligible
             for a larger deduction. An election out of the special depreciation allowance
             disqualifies a vehicle from the higher first year luxury auto limits.

How the Fixed Asset Manager program handles Special Depreciation
Allowance
The Fixed Asset Manager program enters 30% or 50% (depending on the box
that is checked) of the cost or other basis (reduced first by any reduction in



                            Entering and Managing Asset Information              63
             Business Use Percentage, Section 179 Deduction, Other deductions, Salvage
             Value, and ITC basis reduction taken on the asset) when:
                  You have not cleared the New? check box on the Asset Detail pane in the
                   Asset folder, thus indicating that Original Use started after September
                   10, 2001,
                  The date entered in Date placed in service is after September 10, 2001,
                  The Tax system and Depreciation method you selected indicates that the
                   asset may qualify for the Special Depreciation Allowance, and
                  You have selected the Qualified for Special Depr. Allowance (30% or
                   50%) check boxes on the Basis Detail pane, enabling the Special
                   Depreciation Allowance.

             Electing out of the Special Depreciation Allowance
             If you want to elect out of this special allowance, do not select Qualified for
             Special Depr. Allowance (30% or 50%) check boxes on the Basis Detail pane
             enabling the Special Depreciation Allowance calculations.
             You may elect, with respect to any whole class of property, not to have the
             Special Depreciation Allowance apply for all property in such class placed in
             service during the tax year. To make the election, attach a statement to the tax
             return indicating the class(es) of property for which you are electing to not claim
             the Special Depreciation Allowance.

             No AMT Adjustment for Qualified Property
             If an asset does not have an AMT cost basis that is different from its federal cost
             basis, there is no Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) adjustment for property
             qualified for the Special Depreciation Allowance, thus eliminating the AMT
             adjustment for MACRS 200% declining balance property.

             Electing 30% in place of 50% Special Depreciation Allowance
             The law allows you to compute the special depreciation allowance using the 30%
             rate for assets placed in service after May 5, 2003, even if the property qualifies
             for the 50% rate. The election is made separately for each class of property that
             qualifies for the 50% allowance. To make this election, check the 30% box and
             the 50% box. When both boxes are checked, the program calculates up to a
             $7,650 larger deduction for qualifying vehicles subject to the luxury automobile
             limitation, and up to a $22,950 larger deduction for qualifying electric passenger
             automobiles.
             To make this election, check both the 30% and the 50% Qualifying property
             boxes. You must also prepare an election statement and attach it to the clients tax
             return.

Exporting to ProSeries
When you are exporting asset data to ProSeries tax preparation software,
remember that:
     When exporting client data to the ProSeries program, the Special
      Depreciation Allowance calculation is included in the export.
     When Qualified Property is marked either 50% or 30%, the program
      automatically answers the Elect OUT question as No to indicate that
      you want to take the deduction, and that you are not making the election
      to exclude this class of property from the Special Depreciation
      Allowance.
     When Qualified Property is marked 50%, the program automatically
      answers the Elect 30% question as No.
     When Qualified Property is marked 30% and 50% (when electing to use
      30% in place of 50% Special Depreciation Allowance for assets placed in
      service after May 5, 2003), the program automatically answers the Elect
      30% as Yes to indicate that you are electing to use the 30% rate even
      though the property qualifies for the 50% rate.

Entering other deductions
Enter any additional deductions required for this asset. Amounts entered here

cost of an asset for the purposes of determining depreciation for book, state or
other basis. The program does not accept a negative number.

Entering the ITC basis reduction
Enter the amount of Investment Tax Credit (ITC) basis reduction taken. This
amount is used when calculating gain or loss on the disposition of an asset.

Entering the business-use percentage
Enter the percentage of time the active asset is used for business purposes. Fixed
Asset Manager uses this amount to determine the maximum allowable
depreciation.

Calculating accumulated depreciation as of 01/01/90

             for the assets under the tax systems Book, State and Other, and with Non-
             MACRS assets. When you select this item, Fixed Asset Manager automatically
             switches the depreciation method when straight-line generates more
             depreciation. Clear the check box to make this determination manually.

             Entering prior depreciation
             Enter the depreciation taken for prior years. Fixed Asset Manager automatically
             updates this amount when you close the year.

             Current depreciation
             The Current Depreciation field shows depreciation for the current year
             calculated by Fixed Asset Manager.

             Accumulated depreciation
             The Accumulated Depreciation field shows the sum of prior and current
             depreciation calculated by Fixed Asset Manager. You cannot modify this
             summary amount.

             Unrecovered basis
             The Unrecovered Basis field shows the difference when Fixed Asset Manager
             deducts the prior depreciation from the cost/basis of the asset.

             Entering the IRC Section 754 status
             If the clients form type is 1065, you may select this option to indicate that this

Using the Disposal folder to record asset dispositions
                An asset is disposed of when it is sold, abandoned or traded for another asset. For
                tax purposes, you must discontinue depreciation calculations for a disposed of
                asset and determine whether the client sustained a gain or loss from the
                disposition. Enter information about the disposition of an asset in the Disposal
                folder.
                To record the disposal of an asset:
                    1 Select the asset for which you are entering disposition information.
                    2 Click the Disposal tab.

                             8 Enter information in the fields that are described in the following table:


 Field                       Description

 Sale price                  Enter the actual sales price or the fair market value of all property or services
                             received prior to deducting any expenses of the sale or disposal. Adjusted basis is
                             subtracted from this amount to determine the gain or loss.

 Expense of sale             Enter any costs of sales or disposal. Such costs can include advertising, commissions
                             or delivery. This amount is added to the cost or basis to determine the adjusted basis.
                             You cannot enter a negative amount.

 ITC Taken                   Enter the ITC and other credits that affect the sale of the asset. This amount is for
                             informational purposes only.

 Cost or basis               The initial cost or basis appears for the asset. You cannot adjust this amount in the
                             Disposal folder.

 Section 179                 This is any Section 179 deduction taken for the asset. You cannot adjust this amount
 deduction                   in the Disposal folder.

 Special Depr.               This is any Special Depreciation Allowance taken for this asset. You cannot adjust
 Allowance                   this amount in the Disposal folder.

 Disposition basis           Enter a separate regular and AMT basis for assets acquired in a trade if, while in
                             service, the business-use percentage for the disposed of asset was less than 100%.
                             You must adjust the basis of such an asset by reducing it by the prior depreciation
                             constituting the personal use portion. Enter the total recomputed regular and AMT
                             basis for disposition purposes.

 Depreciation after          For Section 1250 property, enter any additional depreciation taken after 1975 to
 1975                        compute the recapture amount. For MACRS residential and nonresidential real
                             property and other section 1250 property depreciated on a straight-line method, there
                             is no additional depreciation.

 Applicable                  Enter 100 for Section 1250 property that is not low-income rental housing. To
 percentage                  determine the applicable percentage for low-income rental housing, see the IRS
                             instructions for Form 4797, Part III.

 Depreciation after          For Section 1250 property, enter additional depreciation taken after 1969 and before
 1969 and before             1976. You may reduce this amount of recapture by the amount, if any, that straight-
 1976                        line depreciation after 1975 exceeded actual depreciation taken after 1975.

                        9 Review the Fixed Asset Manager calculations in the fields that are described
                           in the following table. When you finish entering disposal information, go to
                           the File menu and select Save.


Field                   Description

Accumulated             Fixed Asset Manager calculates accumulated depreciation as current depreciation
depreciation            through the date of disposal plus any prior depreciation. This amount is subtracted
                        from the cost or basis to determine the adjusted basis.

Unrecovered basis       Fixed Asset Manager calculates adjusted basis as:
                        (Cost or Basis + Sales or Disposal Expense)
                        - ITC basis reduction
                        - Other deductions
                        - Accumulated depreciation
                        The program uses the adjusted basis in determining the gain or loss.

Gain/loss on sale       Fixed Asset Manager calculates a gain or loss as Gross Sales Price - Adjusted Basis.

Form 4797 gain/loss     This field is only visible for 1065 and 1120S clients. It shows the Gain/loss on a sale
(excluding Sec. 179)    with the Section 179 deduction excluded.


    Important:          For 1065 and 1120S returns, the gain or loss reported should not include the
                        Section 179 expense deduction because shareholders and partners are required
                        to separately report any recapture of the deduction taken on their individual
                        return. Instead, you must report the full gain or loss in the appropriate part of
                        Form 4797 and separately report the Section 179 expense deduction on
                        Schedule K.




Using the Notes folder to attach preparation notes
                       The Notes folder contains a basic word processor that allows you to make
                       preparation notes about the active asset. When a note is present for a selected
                       asset, the word Note appears in black on the status bar. When a note is not
                       present for a selected asset, the word Note appears dimmed on the status bar.
                       To add or edit notes for the active asset, click the Notes folder.
                       Use the Cut, Copy and Paste options on the Edit menu to move text or to copy
                       information from other folders. To insert the current date and time into the Note,
                       move your cursor to the appropriate place in the note and press the F5 key.

             Tip:       You can also use text editing commands in the Asset and Disposal folders.

                        asset.
                       If youre working in the Asset, Disposal, Projection or Notes folder,
                        Fixed Asset Manager shows the applicable information for the asset.
                       If youre working in the Calendar folder, Fixed Asset Manager selects
                        the date the asset was acquired or disposed.
                       If the client file doesnt include an asset with the asset number you typed
                        in the Find Asset window, Fixed Asset Manager informs you that the
                        asset number does not exist.


                Viewing the next or previous asset

Understanding export procedures
                To copy asset information, including computed depreciation, from a Fixed Asset
                Manager client file to the clients ProSeries return, you need to:
                    1 Prepare the clients Fixed Asset Manager data.
                    2 Export the clients data from Fixed Asset Manager into an export file.
                    3 Import the clients data from the export file into ProSeries.



Preparing a clients data for export
                To prepare a clients Fixed Asset Manager data for export into a ProSeries tax
                return, you need to:
                ?     Make sure you selected the correct type of return for the client
                ?     Link an asset to the appropriate form for each return


                Selecting the type of return
                When you create a company in QuickBooks, one of the first things you do is
                select the clients type of return, such as Form 1120, Form 1120S, Form 1065 or
                Form 1040.
                To change or review this choice after youve created the company in
                QuickBooks:
                    1 Access QuickBooks and open the company associated with the Fixed Asset
                      Manager data you want to export.
                    2 From the Company menu, select Company Information.
                    3 Confirm or change the tax return type for the client using the Income Tax
                      Form Used option.
                    4 Click OK.


                Linking assets to a return
                Next, you need to link each asset to the appropriate form in the clients tax return.
                To do so, go to the Link to Federal Form section of the Asset folder. When
                multiple properties apply, enter or select the name of the property with which the
                asset is to be associated on the tax return.




94      Chapter 7                                                              www.quickbooks.com
   Important:    The property name must be typed exactly as it is typed in the ProSeries tax
                 product to which you are exporting. If the property name appears differently,
                 ProSeries creates a new property with that name.




Creating an export file
                After you create links for the assets that you want to report on the clients tax
                return, you create an export file containing the asset information that you will
                import into the clients ProSeries tax return.
                To create an export file from Fixed Asset Manager:
                 1 From the File menu, select Export, then ProSeries Tax, then Export.
                 2 Follow the instructions provided on each screen.
                 3 Once the transfer is complete, Click OK.



Exporting information to other applications
                This section describes how to export information from Fixed Asset Manager to
                Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and an ASCII or Comma-Separate (CSV)
                file.

         Tip:    Fixed Asset Manager exports data from the Schedule folder based on the
                 active column set, sort set, query and basis. To export other data, create a
                 unique column set, sort set, query and basis.

                       4 Save the document in Microsoft Word.


                   Exporting to an ASCII file

                       2 When the Export to Comma Separated File message appears, type a file
                          name and click Save.
                          The file name text box includes the .csv extension.




Preparing for next year
                   After you file a clients tax return and back up the client files, youre ready to
                   prepare the clients assets for next years depreciation calculations.

     Important:        You cannot make modifications to or create reports for prior-year information.
                       Remember to back up your client files and print any necessary reports before
                       you perform these steps.

                   To prepare assets for next year:
                       1 From the Tools menu, select Prepare for Next Year.
                       2 Review the information in the Prepare for Next Year window.
                       3 If the client is an 1120 corporation, indicate whether the corporation will
                          qualify for the small corporation AMT exemption next year.
